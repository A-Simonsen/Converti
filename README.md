# Converti

A desktop file conversion app built with Electron and Node.js, featuring an extensible plugin architecture.

## About

This is a learning project where I'm teaching myself Node.js and Electron by building something real. I'm using an AI mentor setup (via a custom Claude skill) that guides me through the process with questions and hints rather than handing me solutions — kind of like pair programming with a senior developer.

I'm a CS student with a background in C# and Java, so a lot of the learning is about bridging what I already know into the Node.js ecosystem.

## The Idea

Converti starts as an image format converter, but the goal is to build a **plugin system** so it can be extended to do almost anything — lorem ipsum generation, QR codes, markdown conversion, and whatever else I feel like adding.

## Tech Stack

- **Electron** — Desktop app framework
- **Node.js** — Runtime
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** — No frontend frameworks, keeping it simple

## Current Status

🚧 Work in progress — actively building and learning.
